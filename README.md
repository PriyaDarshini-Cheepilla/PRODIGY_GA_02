# PRODIGY_GA_02

Image Generation with Stable Diffusion
This project uses the Stable Diffusion model to generate images from text prompts. You just give it a description, and it creates a matching image using AI.

✨ What It Does
1. Takes a text prompt (like "a futuristic city at sunset")

2. Uses the runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 model

3. Generates a high-quality image

4. Saves the image in a folder with a timestamped filename

⚙️ How It Works
1. Checks if a GPU is available and uses it (otherwise, runs on CPU)

2. Lets you set a seed to get repeatable results

3. Automatically saves the output in the generated_images folder

▶️ How to Use
1. Run the script

2. Change the prompt in the code to generate different images

3. The image will be saved with a timestamp so files don’t get overwritten

 I HAVE ALSO PROVIDED THE SAMPLE OUTPUT IMAGE AS .png FILE
